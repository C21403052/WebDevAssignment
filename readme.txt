Our website features a responsive mobile-first design thanks to the bootstrap framework. 
Authentication is utilised through session logging which requires users to be logged in to enter certain pages of the website. 
CRUD operations can be completed on the "inventory" page. These edit the persistent database. Rest API and asynchronous communication are both utilised throughout the code. 
This is displayed when functions within the html code call on routes from the server.js. 
Search mechanisms are used through the search bar featured on the website. 
The pop-ups are used to inform the user of actions being completed. This is to ensure that the user is always aware of what is occurring.
